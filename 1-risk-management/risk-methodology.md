## Risk Methodology

Risks are identified across security, privacy, operational, and vendor domains.

Each risk is scored using:
- Likelihood (1–5)
- Impact (1–5)

Risk Score = Likelihood × Impact

Risks are tracked in a centralized risk register and reviewed regularly.
Risk treatment options include:
- Accept
- Mitigate
- Transfer
- Avoid
